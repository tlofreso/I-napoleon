# Semi-Detailed Sequence of Play
I find myself constantly referencing the manual for the high-level setps of each phase. It's often for something simple. This readme tries to cover 90% of the things you need to do in each phase.

## Year Setup Phase 6.0

## Campaign Resolution Phase 9.0
If empty, skip to Campaign Clean-up (step 7)
1. Assign commanders (keep in mind A/G/P you may want to spend on Strategy & Tactics). Pay the cost indicated for every assigned commander regardless of use.
2. Spanish Ulcer (EMD Only)
3. Resolve the Campaign
   - Select Commanders among those assigned (pay attention to any indicated "combat round" restrictions)
   - Add Strategy & Tactics cards. These do not need to be selected ahead of time, and may be used in subsequent combat rounds. Not always the case though... again, pay attention to combat round restrictions.
   - Check hostile nation effects (mid-late game)
   - Check Campaign Modifiers
   - Determine final DRM
   - Flip used commanders face-down. They cannot be used in subsequent combat rounds.
   - Make the combat roll - check for adjusted results (some cards may cause a victory or defeat to become a stalemate) [9.3.8]
     - Bloody Result: Take a bloody result token, set it next to domestic politics. this will -1 DRM for that phase.
     - Stalemate: -2G and -1DRM for next combat round
     - Victory / Defeat: follow card instructions. [9.3.8.2]
4. Check commander casualties. Roll D10 for each commander, regardless of use. on 1, or 2 the commander is discarded.
5. Check Campaign Modifiers for trigger effects after campaign resolution
6. Resolve additional campaigns (some campaigns have additional campaigns that immediately follow)
7. Campaign Cleanup
   - Remove **Campaign Modifiers**, and **Campaigns** that have the "when played" icon in the bottom-right
   - Return **commanders** and **strategy & tactics** cards to their boxes face-up.
   - Return **Potential Campigns** cards to their area
   - Discard Campaign Modifiers that were not removed.

## Diplomatic Phase 10.0
At the start of this phase, you may exchange **Glory** for **Political** *or* **Deplomatic** `3:1`. You may only gain **1** Diplomatic point in this way.

# Other Notes

## Napoleon's Luck
Napoleon's Luck may be used once per year for the following:
- To re-roll any one die roll
- To immediately ignore any one mandatory card just drawn and redraw a new card instead
- During campaign resolution phase, use napoleon's luck instead of paying the cost of any one Commander or Strategy & Tactics card.
